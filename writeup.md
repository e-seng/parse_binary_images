# Spooky Binary Images

## problem:
given these two images, find an associated URL

![one image with a whole bunch of black and white pixels](./0.png "a lot of black and white pixels")
![another iamge with a whole bunch of black and white pixels](./1.png "wow, more black and white pixels")

## my process:
### initial thoughts:
### uh oh, it's not ascii binary
### making a new binary image
### getting the solution
